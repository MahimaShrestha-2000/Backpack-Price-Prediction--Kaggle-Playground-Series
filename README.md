# Backpack Price Prediction (A Kaggle Playground Challenge)

### Challenge Overview

This project is part of a Kaggle Playground competition designed to help participants strengthen their skills in machine learning and data analytics. The challenge focuses on predicting the prices of backpacks based on multiple features and variables such as material, size, brand, color, and more. 

The goal is to build an accurate regression model that can effectively estimate product prices and uncover the key factors influencing them.

## Dataset
I got the Dataset from Kaggle's challenge page. There were three different datasets train, train_extra, and test dataset. 

### Key Features:
- Color
- Brand
- Material
- WaterProof
- Laptop Compartment
